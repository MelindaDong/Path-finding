# Path-finding
BFS / UCS /  A* Search / Pathfinding by direct optimisation (simulated annealing)

### input map

example input map is provided, see `map.text`, first line is the size of the map, second line is the start location and the third line is the goal location, the rest is the map, `X` means obstacles. 

### Problem Formulation

States: Any obstacle-free position (i, j) on the map.
Initial States: A position (i0, j0) given by the user.
Actions: Since we consider 4-connectedness, only four actions are available: Up, down, left and right (your program must expand each node in this order). Available actions for positions adjacent to the map boundary or obstacles are reduced accordingly.
Transition Model: Moving left moves the current position to the left, etc.
Goal Test: Check if the current state is the end position (i*, j*) given by the user.
Path Cost: Given a map M and a Path P{(i0, j0), (i1, j1), ... (iN, jN)}, the cost of the path is calculated as:

$$g\left(P\right)=\sum_{k=1}^Nc\left(i_{k-1},j_{k-1},i_k,j_k,M\right)$$,

where

$c\left(a,b,c,d,M\right)=\begin{cases}1+M\left(c,d\right)-M\left(a,b\right) & if M(c,d) - M(a, b) > 0\\1 & otherwise \end{cases}$

and M(a, b) is the elevation at the position (a, b). In words, the cost of a path is the sum of the costs between adjacent points in the path, and the cost between adjacent points is 1 plus the difference between the elevation of the two points if we climb "uphill" or simply 1 if we stay "level" or slide "downhill".


code can be called as following:

__>>> python pathfinder.py [map] [algorithm] [heuristic]__

- [algorithm] specifies the search algorithm to use, with the possible values of __bfs__, __ucs__, and __astar__.
- [heuristic] specifies the heuristic to use for A* search, with the possible values of __euclidean__ and __manhattan__. This input is ignored for BFS and UCS.



__>>> python sapathfinder.py [map] [init] [tini] [tfin] [alpha] [d]__

The inputs/options to the program are as follows:

- [map] specifies the path to the map as formatted in `pathfinder.py`
- [init] specifies the path to an initial path, encoded according to the output of the program (as `pathfinder.py`)
- [tini] and [tfin] specify the intial and final temperature respectively.
- [alpha] specifies the cooling rate
- [d] specifies the segment length for random local path adjustments.
